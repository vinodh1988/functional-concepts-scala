Scala does not have checked vs unchecked exceptions

checked - mandatory handling is needed
unchecked - no mandatory handling

the method that causes checked exceptionn must notify the caller
by using throws keyword

since scala has no checked vs unchecked categories there is no throws keyword

in scala to handle exceptions

four keywords

1. try
2. throw
3. catch
4. finally

there is no separate exception hierarchy in scala
it is same as java

we use same java classes to represent exceptions

like java
1. Throwable
   1. Error
   2. Exception
       1. RuntimeException
       2. IOException
       3. SQLException
       4. etc
